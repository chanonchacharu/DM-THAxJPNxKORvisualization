This is part of DES434 Data Mining and Machine Learning Midterm Project. The aim of this project is to explore the data and construct hypothesis testing. Students are free to select any dataset from Kaggle under the theme "Movie and Drama". 

## Dataset Creation

Previously, I have uploaded a dataset onto Kaggle on Korean Drama from 2015-2023. With slight modification and feature engineering, the code that was used to scrape the data was implemented for Thai and Japanese Drama intead. The data that was used for this project is comprised into the following dataset: "Thai and Japanese Drama vs. Korean Drama Dominance"

## Hypothesis Testing 
There are two questions that need to be answer for this project
1. Is there a significant difference in the average viewer ratings of drama TV shows among these three countries?
2. What is the most popular geners of drama from each countires (Thailand, Japan, and Korea)? How do they compare with other countires?

Note: These two questions are subject to change if the data doesn't support the discovery process or there are more worthy questions to explore

## To be continue
