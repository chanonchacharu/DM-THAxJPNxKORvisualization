This is part of DES434 Data Mining and Machine Learning Midterm Project. The aim of this project is to explore the data and construct hypothesis testing. Students are free to select any dataset from Kaggle under the theme "Movie and Drama". 

## Dataset Creating 

Previously, I have uploaded a dataset onto Kaggle on Korean Drama from 2015-2023. With slight modification and feature engineering, the code that was used to scrape the data was implemented for Thai and Japanese Drama intead. The data that was used for this project is comprised into the following dataset: "Thai and Japanese Drama vs. Korean Drama Dominance"
